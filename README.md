# S.T.A.C.K.E.R. Clear Bag

An homage to one of my favorite games of all time, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl. Built for Ludum Dare 42. The name is inspired by [Neil Thapen's](https://twitter.com/pishtaq) amazing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. demake [S.T.A.C.K.E.R.](https://thapen.itch.io/stacker) and the Shadow of Chernobyl prequel Clear Sky.

Main menu music is quite obviously the great Bandit Radio from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky. In particular, this is a MIDI accordion version made from [JdebMkay](https://musescore.com/user/181798/scores/1786136)'s excellent piano arrangement.

In-game music is [kickhat's cool ambient soundtrack](https://freesound.org/people/kickhat/sounds/435147/
